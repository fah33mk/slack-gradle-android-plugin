<h2>ü§¨ Problem Statement</h2>
Optimize deployment by sharing software builds internally, reducing CI/CD costs for minor code changes.
<br></br>
**Efficient Workflow with Git Integration and Slack Notifications**

* In certain scenarios, immediately deploying new software from Git directly into production may not always be the most
  feasible approach. Likewise, utilizing valuable CI/CD build minutes for every minor code modification may not be
  the best utilization of resources. What if there was a way to streamline the process and share software builds
  internally without incurring the costs associated with CI/CD?

**Simplifying Deployment and Communication**

* Our innovative plugin will address this challenge by streamlining and optimizing the software deployment workflow.
  By leveraging Git integration and Slack notifications, it minimizes the effort needed to deliver software to your
  customers efficiently. With this approach, you can share builds within an intended internal group on Slack, saving
  both time

# Getting Started

There are two parts to installing this plugin. The first part is for creating a Slack bot account with which the plugin
uses to upload a file and the second part is, of course, installing it into your Gradle script.

## Create the Slack Bot

Unless your Slack administrator has banned unapproved apps from being installed into your workspace, then just about
anyone should be able to follow these steps.

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps/)
1. Press the *Create New App* button. Apps within Slack enable automated bots to post messages to a Slack channel.
1. In the pop-up dialog, give the app a friendly name. This name is for your reference only and is not reflected as the
   bot's name in a Slack workspace whenever it posts a message. You will configure the bot's name later.

    <img alt="Slack application creation dialog" src=".docs/screenshots/create-app.png" width="320" />

1. After creating the app, click on the *Bots* button, under the *Add Features and Functionality* section

    <img alt="Add bot functionality" src=".docs/screenshots/add-bot-functionality.png" width="320" />

1. Click the *Add a Bot User* button and fill out the form. The Display Name is effectively the bot's First and Last
   Name, which appears as the sender of a Slack message. You can populate this form as you please. Here is an example
   set up:

    <img alt="Bot user details" src=".docs/screenshots/bot-user-details.png" width="320" />

1. Save your changes and the go back to the *Basic Information* page, which is available from the left-column navigation
1. Under the *Add Features and Functionality* section, both the *Bots* and *Permissions* features should show as
   completed

    <img alt="Completed Features and Functionality" src=".docs/screenshots/completed-features-and-functionality.png" width="320" />

1. **(Optional)** Populate the *Display Information*. This can be thought of as the bot's profile picture and status
   message.

    <img alt="Completed Features and Functionality" src=".docs/screenshots/display-information.png" width="320" />

1. Click on *Install Your App to Your Workspace* and follow Slack's installation and permission prompts
1. After installing the app, go back to the app's configuration
1. On the left-column navigation go to *OAuth & Permissions*
1. Make a note of the *Bot User OAuth Access Token* (not the OAuth Access Token). You will need this for a subsequent
   step. **Keep this token safe, as having access to it enables anyone to send messages to your workspace.**

## Install the Plugin into Gradle

After adding a bot account to Slack, we now have enough information to add the plugin to Gradle.

### Using the Plugins DSL (Recommended)

Newer version of Gradle support the
updated [plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block). These steps show how to
install the plugin with this technique.

1. Note the latest release of this plugin for use in the next step:
1. Open your `build.gradle` file, and add this code to load and apply the plugin:

    ```groovy
    plugins {
        id "com.faheem.gradle.slack" version "1.0.5"
    }
    ```

### Using the Legacy Plugin Application

Older versions of Gradle do not support the
modern [plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block). Use this technique if the
above approach fails.

1. Note the latest release of this plugin for use in the next step:
1. Open your `build.gradle` file, and add this code to load and apply the plugin:

    ```groovy
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
        }

        dependencies {
            classpath "com.faheem.gradle.slack:slackGradleAndroidPlugin:1.0.5"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Now, apply it:

    ```groovy
    apply plugin: "com.faheem.gradle.slack:slackGradleAndroidPlugin"
    ```

### Using JitPack (Not Recommended)

For the sake of convinence, this plugin is also available on JitPack. These steps show how to install the plugin from
there.

1. Note the latest release of this plugin for use in the next
   step: [Latest Release - 1.0.6](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.github.fah33mk.slack)
1. Note the stable release of this plugin
   is: [Stable Release - 1.0.5](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.github.fah33mk.slack)
1. Open your `build.gradle` file, and add this code to load the plugin:

    ```groovy
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }

        dependencies {
            classpath "com.faheem.gradle.slack:slackGradleAndroidPlugin:1.0.5"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Now, apply it:

    ```groovy
    apply plugin: "com.faheem.gradle.slack:slackGradleAndroidPlugin"
    ```

# Configuring the Plugin

There are a few ways you can use this plugin, depending on your needs. You may wish to adapt how you use this based on
your setup. Before diving into the code, let's cover what this plugin offers:

- **Configuration Block For Single Build Upload:** You must *always* configure this plugin with a block since it has
  required paramters:

    ```groovy
    uploadFileToSlack {
        ...
    }
    ```

  Otherwise, your build will fail with an exception until the necessary information is provided.
- **Task:** To manually kick off an upload task, run the `uploadFileToSlack` task, like so:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew uploadFileToSlack
    ```

  Keep in mind you'll probably want a few commands beforehand to run a build and generate artifacts.

## Configuration Block Options

There are several parameters which are provided to alter the behavior of the plugin. Here is an example of a fully
configured block:

```groovy
uploadFileToSlack {
    comment "Our app is ready for release!"
    channels "public-release-channel", "developers"
    enabled true
    filePath "build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk"
    token GRADLE_SLACK_UPLOADER_PLUGIN_TOKEN ?: "" // Defined in the global gradle.properties file
}
```

Here is an elaboration of each of these options:

| **Option** | **Default** | **Required** |                        **Description**                        |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `comment`  |   *None*    |      ‚úÖ       | The comment which is shown above the file attachment in Slack |
| `channels` |   *None*    |      ‚úÖ       | Comma separated list of channels which will receive the file  |
| `filePath` |   *None*    |      ‚úÖ       |  Path of the artifact to upload relative to the project root  |
|  `token`   |   *None*    |      ‚úÖ       |                Slack bot's OAuth access token                 |


## Flavour & Variant Based Upload Tasks

### Write/Add Script to support multi flavour and variant support

1. Create a `.gradle` file into your project
2. Add this [slack.gradle](scripts/slack.gradle) into your android project.
3. This file will create multiple tasks into your gradle scripts which will include
    1. Variant based single or multiple `apk` uploader
    2. Flavour based single or multiple `apk` uploader
    3. Variant based single or multiple `bundle` uploader
    4. Flavour based single or multiple `bundle` uploader
    5. One task to send all the variants and flavoured apk's
    6. Before creating build it run all tests in the project
4. Go into your app level `build.gradle` file and add `apply from: 'slack.gradle'`

### Sync Project & Open Gradle Task List

1. Once project sync is completed open gradle tab in your android studio. Make sure that on sync all the gradle tasks
   are being created. If you are not sure
   see [Gradle Task is Missing on Android Studio](https://medium.com/@mockreader/gradle-task-is-missing-on-android-studio-4-2-f7838bc22909).
2. Once you get all the task list look for a group/folder named as `slack`
3. Expand or open
4. You will see all the list of tasks as given below:

<b>Note:</b> in this example I had two flavours

1. GMS (Builds for Devices having Google Play Services)
2. HMS (Builds for Devices having Huawei Mobile Services)

<img alt="Gradle Task List" src=".docs/screenshots/tasks-list.png"/>

### Task `sendForSanityTesting`

This task is created when after all the development & testing is completed you the final testing of the builds and get
ready for deploy.
This task will share below list of builds

1. All flavours Release APK
2. All flavours Release Bundle

### Run
1. Double-click on any script form the list
2. Manually start a task e,g `sendAll` 
    ```bash
    ./gradlew sendAll
    ```
   
Note: The tasks will run `assemble`, `bundle` and `tests` scripts by itself so you don't need to call them first to upload any build.
